# 1.	Introduction 
Detect Pneumonia from chest X-ray images by using deep learning. There are two kinds of labels, normal and pneumonia. Implement dl model architecture and show the accuracy.
# 2.	Experiment setups 
a.	The detail of your model 
Architecture: Desnet161
Loss: Cross Entropy
Learning rate: 1e-4
Optimizer: Adam
Weight decay: 1e-4
b.	The detail of you Dataloder 
Batch size = 10
Preprocess:
transform.Resize(255),
transform.CenterCrop(224),
transform.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
transform.RandomRotation(10),
transform.RandomGrayscale(),
transform.RandomAffine(translate=(0.05,0.05), degrees=0),
transform.ToTensor()
# 3.	Experiment result
a.	Highest testing accuracy and F1-score (Screenshot) 
 
b.	Ploting the comparsion figure 
 
 
c. Anything you want to present 
	the distribution of normal and pneumonia isnâ€™t balanced.
# 4.	Discussion 
a.	Anything you want to share 
The best accuracy is beyond 98%, which means that desnet161 is a good architecture for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images
